    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      We specialize in reinforced water activated tape used for sealing
      heavy-duty cartons in e-commerce, warehousing, logistics, and export
      packaging. Our tapes are engineered to form a permanent bond with
      corrugated cartons, offering clear tamper evidence and long-term
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      By combining strong reinforcement with water-activated adhesive
      technology, our products help businesses improve carton integrity
      while reducing dependence on plastic-based packaging materials.
